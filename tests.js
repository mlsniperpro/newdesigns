JOURNAL OF L A T E X CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021   1  Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: A Roadmap  Shirui Pan,   Senior Member, IEEE , Linhao Luo, Yufei Wang, Chen Chen, Jiapu Wang, Xindong Wu,   Fellow, IEEE  Abstract —Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify
d. For closed-source LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4), AutoKG adopts prompt engineering to design customized prompts [96]. As shown in Fig. 20, these prompts contain the task description, few- shot examples, and test input, which instruct LLMs to predict the tail entity for KG completion.  5.2.3   Comparison between PaE and PaG  LLMs as Encoders (PaE) applies an additional prediction head on the top of the representation encoded by LLMs. Therefore, the PaE framework is much easier to finetune since we can only optimize the prediction heads and freeze the LLMs. Moreover, the output of the prediction can be eas- ily specified and integrated with existing KGC functions for different KGC tasks. However, during the inference stage, the PaE requires to compute a score for every candidate in KGs, which could be computationally expensive. Besides, they   cannot   generalize   to   unseen   entities.   Furthermore, the PaE requires the representation output of the LLMs, whereas some state-of-the-
sociated knowledge graph. The question and verbalized paths are encoded by the language model, and different layers of the language model produce outputs that guide a graph neural network to perform message pass- ing. This process utilizes the explicit knowledge contained in the structured knowledge graph for reasoning purposes. StructGPT [242] adopts a customized interface to allow large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) directly reasoning on KGs to perform multi-step question answering.  6   S YNERGIZED   LLM S   + KG S  The synergy of LLMs and KGs has attracted increasing attention these years, which marries the merits of LLMs and KGs to mutually enhance performance in various down- stream applications. For example, LLMs can be used to understand natural language, while KGs are treated as a knowledge base, which provides factual knowledge. The unification of LLMs and KGs could result in a powerful model for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this section, we will discuss the
